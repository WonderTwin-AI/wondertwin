# Declares which twins to run locally, their ports, and configuration.
# The `wt` CLI reads this file to manage twin lifecycle.
#
# For v0.1, twin binaries must be pre-compiled and available at the
# configured `binary` path. No registry download yet.
#
# To test with saltwyk-sim twins:
#   1. cd /path/to/saltwyk-sim && make build
#   2. Copy this file to wondertwin.yaml and adjust binary paths
#   3. wt up

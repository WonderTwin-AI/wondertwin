# wondertwin.yaml — WonderTwin project manifest
#
# Declares which twins to run locally, their ports, and configuration.
# The `wt` CLI reads this file to manage twin lifecycle.
#
# Twins can be configured in two ways:
#
# 1. Version-based (recommended): Set `version` and run `wt install` to
#    download pre-compiled binaries from the WonderTwin registry.
#
# 2. Binary path: Set `binary` to a local path for custom or pre-built twins.
#
# Quick start with registry twins:
#   1. Copy this file to wondertwin.yaml
#   2. wt install
#   3. wt up

  # Version-based twin — downloaded from registry via `wt install`
